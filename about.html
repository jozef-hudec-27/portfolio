                Hello, my name is Jozef Hudec and I'm a full-stack web developer from Slovakia with experience in a variety of
                technologies and frameworks. My main expertise lies in Ruby and Rails, HTML and CSS. I have a strong passion for
                web development and am constantly seeking out new and exciting projects to work on. I have experience working on
                a variety of projects, that provided me with a solid foundation in web development best practices and methodologies.
                In my free time, I enjoy staying up to date with the latest developments in web technologies and experimenting with
                new tools and frameworks. I am always looking to expand my skill set and take on new challenges in the world of web
                development.
            </p>

            As a web developer, your skill set is one of the most important things you have. It can
            make the difference between an employer contacting you or the same employer not giving
            you a chance. I believe you should always seek to enrich your technology tool set, because
            that's what separates a good programmer from a bad one. Always striving to be better. Here's
            a list of technologies I've worked and have some experience with, ordered by how confident
            I am with each one.
